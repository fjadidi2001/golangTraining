/*
Processing HTTP requests with Go is primarily about two things: handlers and servemuxes.

If youâ€™re coming from an MVC-background, you can think of handlers as being a bit like controllers.
Generally speaking, they're responsible for carrying out your application logic and writing response
headers and bodies.

Whereas a servemux (also known as a router) stores a mapping between the predefined URL paths
for your application and the corresponding handlers. Usually you have one servemux for your application
containing all your routes.

Go's net/http package ships with the simple but effective http.ServeMux servemux,
plus a few functions to generate common handlers including http.FileServer(), http.NotFoundHandler()
and http.RedirectHandler().
