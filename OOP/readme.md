**Go is not a pure object oriented programming language.**
- Go has types and methods and allows an object-oriented style of programming, there is no type hierarchy
- There are also ways to embed types in other types to provide something analogous—but not identical—to subclassing. 
- Go doesn't support constructors
- so in the go we have New function replacement constructor in another language like java or c++ ,... syntax:`New(parameters)`
- go does not support inheritance but it does support composition(put together).
