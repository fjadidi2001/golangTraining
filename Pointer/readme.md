# Pointer
**A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.**<br>
***T** is the type of the pointer variable which points to a value of type T.


## Passing pointer to a function
we should use func for change value 


## Returning pointer from a function
It is perfectly legal for a function to return a pointer of a local variable.<br> 
The Go compiler is intelligent enough and it will allocate this variable on the heap
