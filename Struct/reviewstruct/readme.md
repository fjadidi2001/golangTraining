# Struct
A struct is a **user-defined** type that represents a collection of fields.
<br>
# anonymous structs
It is possible to declare structs without creating a new data type<br>
# Accessing individual fields of a struct
The dot . operator is used to access the individual fields of a struct.
# zero value
When a struct is defined and it is not explicitly initialized with any value, the fields of the struct are assigned their zero values by default.

If a struct type starts with a capital letter, then it is an exported type and it can be accessed from other packages<br>
Structs are value types and are comparable if each of their fields are comparable. Two struct variables are considered equal if their corresponding fields are equal.
